## ✅ What I Have Built

I chose **Soccer** as the sport and built a **responsive web app** that displays upcoming soccer matches with:

- 🧠 **Real-time Search**: Filter teams instantly
- 🧾 **Match Info**: Team names and match date/time
- 🌐 **Freely Available API** used for fetching data
- 🖥️ **Backend** with Express.js to serve the data
- 📸 **Clean UI** and fully tested with Postman

## 🌐 API Used

I have used a public soccer API for upcoming matches:

**API:** [https://www.scorebat.com/video-api/v3/](https://www.scorebat.com/video-api/v3/)

> No authentication required. Returns JSON data for upcoming soccer matches.
